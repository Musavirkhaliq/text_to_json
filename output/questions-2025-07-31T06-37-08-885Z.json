    "explanation": "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with the help of chlorophyll.  It involves absorbing carbon dioxide and water, using sunlight as energy to convert these into glucose (a sugar) and oxygen.  The glucose provides energy for the plant's growth and other processes, while the oxygen is released into the atmosphere.  The process occurs in chloroplasts within plant cells."
