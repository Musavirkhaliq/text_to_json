This means stations A and B are free from local attraction. \nFor line BC: |BB - FB| = |323° - 145°| = 178°. This difference is not 180°, so either B or C (or both) is affected. \nSince we established from line AB that station B is free from local attraction, the fore bearing of BC (145°), which was measured from B, must be correct. Consequently, the back bearing of BC (323°), measured from station C, must be incorrect. Therefore, station C is affected by local attraction."
