Since |ψ₀⟩ is the ground state, E₀ is the lowest energy, meaning E₀ < Eₙ for all n≠0. Therefore, the denominator (E₀ - Eₙ) is always negative. As the numerator |⟨ψₙ|H₁|ψ₀⟩|² is always non-negative (positive if the matrix element is non-zero), the sum of negative terms results in E₀⁽²⁾ being always negative or zero for the ground state. It depends on all other states (discrete and continuous) of H₀, not just the first excited state."

That is, ⟨φ|H|φ⟩ ≥ E₀. If |φ⟩ is not normalized, then ⟨φ|H|φ⟩ / ⟨φ|φ⟩ ≥ E₀. This principle provides an upper bound to E₀. It can never yield a value lower than E₀. The expectation value does not have to be positive (e.g., for bound states where E₀ < 0). Orthogonality to excited states is not sufficient for equality unless |φ⟩ is the true ground state itself."

For a potential well with two 'soft' turning points (where the potential V(x) changes smoothly and is finite at E=V(x)), each turning point contributes a phase change of π/4. With two such turning points, the total phase correction in the integral leads to γ = 1/2. For a potential that rises infinitely sharply at one turning point and is smooth at the other, γ = 3/4. For two infinite walls, the phase integral is typically written as (n+1)πħ (for n=0,1,2...) or nπħ (for n=1,2,3...)."

The spin triplet state (S=1) is symmetric under particle exchange (e.g., |↑↑⟩, (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/√2, |↓↓⟩).

(3) It correctly predicts the fine structure of atomic spectra, including the spin-orbit interaction, without needing to be added ad-hoc. However, the Dirac equation describes the behavior of single, non-interacting (or electromagnetically interacting) fermions.

      "explanation": "When two observables A and B do not commute ([A, B] ≠ 0), they cannot be simultaneously measured with arbitrary precision. Measuring A forces the system into an eigenstate of A. If this eigenstate is not also an eigenstate of B (which it generally won't be if A and B don't commute), then the subsequent measurement of B will project the system into one of B's eigenstates with a certain probability distribution. This process of measuring A thus 'disturbs' the system with respect to B, meaning the state after the A-measurement is not necessarily one that would lead to a definite outcome for B. The uncertainty principle dictates the *precision* of simultaneous measurements, not that one observable becomes 'unmeasurable'. A precise measurement of A indeed makes a precise prediction for B impossible (unless by coincidence the eigenstate of A is also an eigenstate of B), but B can certainly still be measured, just with an uncertain outcome."
