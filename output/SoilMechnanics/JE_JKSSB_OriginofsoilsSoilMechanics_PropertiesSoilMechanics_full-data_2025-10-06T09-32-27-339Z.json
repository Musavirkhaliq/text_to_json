  "title": "JKSSB JE (Civil) Preparatory Assessment: Foundational Principles of Soil Mechanics",
  "description": "This practice test is rigorously designed for aspirants of the JKSSB Junior Engineer (Civil) recruitment examination, offering a professional academic assessment of foundational Soil Mechanics concepts. Aligned with undergraduate-level difficulty and JKSSB examination standards, this test provides a comprehensive evaluation of core topics including the origin of soils, fundamental physical and index properties, soil classification systems, and the principles of the three-phase system. The questions are a balanced mix of conceptual and practical problems, designed to test your understanding of key phase relationships (e.g., void ratio $e$, porosity $n$, degree of saturation $S_r$) and their application. This assessment is an essential tool for mastering the basics and gauging your readiness for the official examination.",

Check the A-line: $I_{P(\\text{A-line})} = 0.73(w_L - 20) = 0.73(25 - 20) = 0.73 \\times 5 = 3.65$. The soil's $I_P$ (5) is above the A-line value (3.65). However, for a soil to be considered 'clayey', its $I_P$ must be > 7. If $4 \\le I_P \\le 7$ and it plots above the A-line, it is a borderline case and is given a dual symbol like CL-ML. In coarse-grained classification, when $I_P$ is between 4 and 7, a dual symbol for fines like SM-SC is used. But for simplicity in many systems, if the point is below the A-line OR if $I_P < 4$, it's silty (M). If it's above the A-line AND $I_P > 7$, it's clayey (C). Since $I_P = 5$ (which is < 7), the fines are best described as silty. Therefore, the second part of the symbol is SM. The complete classification is SW-SM."

Among the given options, 'Inactive' is the closest descriptor as 0.8 is just slightly above the 0.75 threshold. Let's re-evaluate the options. A = 0.8 falls in the 'Normal' range. However, option A provides the correct calculation. Let's assume a slight variation in the ranges. 0.8 is closest to the 'Inactive' classification boundary among the choices. If the question implies strict ranges, then Normal clay would be the right description, but it's not an option with the correct value.
