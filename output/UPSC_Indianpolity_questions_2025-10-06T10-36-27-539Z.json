    ],
    "points": 2,
    "explanation": "This question tests the analytical understanding of the Anti-Defection Law's implementation. Option (c) is correct because the core governance challenge lies in the Speaker's delay in deciding disqualification petitions. While the Kihoto Hollohan case established the Speaker's role as a tribunal and made the decision subject to judicial review (on grounds of perversity, mala fides, etc.), it did not set a time limit. This lacuna is frequently exploited by ruling parties to manage their numbers in the legislature, as Speakers (who often retain their party affiliation) can delay decisions on defecting members to suit political exigencies. The Supreme Court, in recent cases like the one involving the Manipur legislative assembly, has strongly urged Parliament to amend the Constitution to create an independent tribunal or vest this power in a body other than the Speaker to preserve the integrity of the democratic process. This highlights a critical friction point between a constitutional provision and its practical, often political, application in governance."

      }
    ],
    "points": 2,
    "explanation": "This question requires a nuanced understanding of current trends in fiscal federalism. Option (b) is the correct answer. While Finance Commissions (like the 15th FC) have recommended a substantial share (41%) for states, the Union government's increasing use of cesses and surcharges (e.g., Health and Education Cess) effectively reduces the size of the net divisible pool of taxes. According to Article 270 of the Constitution, the revenue from cesses and surcharges need not be shared with the states. This practice undermines the spirit of fiscal federalism, as it allows the Centre to raise revenue for specific purposes while keeping it outside the shareable pool, thereby impacting the fiscal autonomy and resources of state governments. This has been a major point of contention raised by several states, highlighting a structural issue in Centre-State financial relations."

    "points": 2,
    "explanation": "This question tests the precise application of the Basic Structure Doctrine. Option (b) is the most accurate example. The doctrine, established in the Kesavananda Bharati case, holds that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution (Article 368), it cannot alter its 'basic structure'. The striking down of the 99th Amendment, which established the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC), is a classic and contemporary application of this doctrine. The Court held that the 'independence of the judiciary' is part of the basic structure, and the NJAC, with its proposed composition, compromised this independence. This decision reignited the debate on parliamentary sovereignty versus judicial supremacy, with critics arguing it amounts to judicial overreach, while proponents see it as a necessary safeguard for constitutionalism. Options (a) and (d) are examples of judicial activism or interpretation, not the application of the Basic Structure Doctrine to strike down a constitutional amendment."

    "points": 2,
    "explanation": "This question analyzes the gap between the constitutional ideal and the ground reality of local self-governance. Option (b) correctly identifies the core problem. The 73rd Amendment provided the constitutional framework for PRIs, but the actual devolution of power rests with the state legislatures. The most significant challenge to the autonomy of PRIs is the unwillingness of state governments and their bureaucracies to transfer meaningful power. This is often referred to as the problem of the '3 Fs': Functions (clear delineation of responsibilities), Funds (financial autonomy and adequate resources, often hampered by tied grants), and Functionaries (control over local administrative staff). State governments frequently create parallel bodies or run schemes through their own departments, bypassing PRIs and reducing them to mere implementing agencies rather than vibrant institutions of self-government. Option (a) is factually incorrect as Article 243K mandates State Election Commissions. Option (c) is a biased and unsubstantiated claim; reservations are a tool for social justice and political empowerment."

    "points": 2,
    "explanation": "This question tests the critical understanding of the President's powers within the framework of a parliamentary democracy. Option (c) is the most constitutionally contentious action. Under Article 74, the President is bound by the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers. While the President can use a suspensive veto (return a non-Money Bill once for reconsideration), the exercise of an absolute veto (withholding assent) on a bill passed by Parliament, against the advice of the government, would be a major constitutional crisis. It would violate the fundamental principle of the parliamentary system where the elected government holds the real executive power. Option (a) is incorrect because the President cannot return a Money Bill. Option (b) is a valid exercise of power as Parliament (and by extension, the President during ordinances) can legislate on state subjects during President's Rule (Article 356). Option (d) is also a valid exercise of the President's wider pardoning power, which is independent of the Governor's."
