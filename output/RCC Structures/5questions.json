      "explanation": "Serviceability limit states relate to the performance of the structure under normal service conditions. For beams and slabs, the primary concerns are ensuring that deflections are not excessive (which could damage finishes or be aesthetically unpleasing) and that crack widths are controlled to prevent corrosion and maintain durability. Strength and failure modes are checked under the ultimate limit state."
