      "explanation": "The question is a practical application of admixtures. The 30% water reduction is the maximum potential of the admixture to achieve the *same* workability. Here, the goal is to *increase* workability (slump from 50 to 120 mm) while keeping the w/c ratio constant. This is achieved by adding the superplasticizer, which significantly enhances fluidity without adding more water. The actual water content remains the same, but the admixture's effect is equivalent to what would be achieved by adding a significant amount of water. To achieve such a large slump increase, a substantial dose of superplasticizer is used, effectively 'releasing' water trapped in cement flocs. This provides high workability, equivalent to a much wetter mix, but without the strength loss. The effect is analogous to a significant reduction in water demand, typically in the range of 15-20%, to achieve the target slump."

While low workability can cause honeycombing due to poor compaction, the key factor mentioned here is the height of the drop, which directly points to segregation."
