The calculated $x_u$ (120.3 mm) is greater than the flange depth $D_f$ (120 mm), so the initial assumption is incorrect. The neutral axis lies in the web. A more accurate calculation is required: $C_u = T_u \\Rightarrow 0.36 f_{ck} b_w x_u + 0.45 f_{ck} (b_f - b_w) D_f = 0.87 f_y A_{st}$. $0.36 \\times 25 \\times 300 \\times x_u + 0.45 \\times 25 \\times (1000-300) \\times 120 = 0.87 \\times 415 \\times 3000$. $2700 x_u + 945000 = 1083150 \\Rightarrow 2700 x_u = 138150 \\Rightarrow x_u = 51.1$ mm. This result ($x_u < D_f$) contradicts the assumption that the NA is in the web. This indicates an inconsistency in the problem's data or options. However, let's reconsider the first calculation: $x_u=120.3$ mm. This value is very close to $D_f=120$ mm. There might be a typo in the question's parameters. If we assume the question intended for the NA to be in the flange, and that one of the options is correct, we can work backward. If we assume a flange width of 1200 mm instead of 1000 mm: $x_u = \\frac{0.87 \\times 415 \\times 3000}{0.36 \\times 25 \\times 1200} = 100.29 \\text{ mm}$.

A properly detailed reinforcement cage contains the concrete core, controls the widening of helical cracks, and allows the steel reinforcement to yield before the concrete crushes. This ensures a ductile failure mode, which is a primary objective of the limit state design philosophy, providing warning before collapse."
