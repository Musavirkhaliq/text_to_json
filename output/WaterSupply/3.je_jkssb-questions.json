    "explanation": "Alkalinity is a measure of the water's ability to neutralize acids (i.e., its buffering capacity). Biological processes like nitrification (the conversion of ammonia to nitrate) are acid-producing and consume alkalinity, which can cause a significant drop in pH. Sufficient alkalinity is crucial to buffer this acid production and maintain the pH within a range that is optimal for the nitrifying bacteria to function effectively."
