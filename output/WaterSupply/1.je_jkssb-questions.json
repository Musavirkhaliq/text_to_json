A well-functioning PST can remove 50-70% of suspended solids and 30-40% of the Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)."

    "explanation": "Recirculation in a high-rate trickling filter involves pumping a portion of the treated effluent back to the filter inlet. This increases the total flow (hydraulic load) through the filter, which creates a higher shearing velocity that continuously sloughs off the biofilm. This self-cleaning action prevents the filter from clogging (ponding) and controls the nuisance of psychoda flies, allowing it to handle higher organic loads than a standard-rate filter."

Methane is a potent fuel and can be captured to produce heat or electricity, making it a valuable byproduct."

Sufficient additional volume must be provided below the settling zone to store the accumulated sludge and scum for a long period (6-12 months), during which anaerobic digestion stabilizes the organic matter. This dual-volume consideration is a key design principle."
