    "explanation": "The head loss ($h_f$) is inversely proportional to the diameter raised to the power of 4.87 ($h_f \\propto 1/D^{4.87}$). If the diameter D is doubled (becomes 2D), the new head loss ($h_f'$) will be proportional to $1/(2D)^{4.87}$, which is $1/(2^{4.87} \\times D^{4.87})$. \\\\ The factor of decrease is $2^{4.87}$. Approximating this, $2^5 = 32$. Therefore, doubling the pipe diameter reduces the head loss by a factor of approximately 32. This shows the significant impact of pipe diameter on friction losses."

    "explanation": "The described problem is water hammer, caused by the sudden stop of flowing water, which creates a high-pressure shockwave. A water hammer arrestor is a specialized device containing a cushion of air or gas separated from the water by a piston or diaphragm. It is installed in the pipe near the offending fixture and works by absorbing the pressure surge, thus safely and quietly dissipating the shockwave."

    "explanation": "The relationship is given by Q ∝ D^2.63. Let Q1 and D1 be the initial values, and Q2 and D2 be the new values. The ratio of capacities is (Q2/Q1) = (D2/D1)^2.63. Given D2 = 300 mm and D1 = 150 mm, the ratio (D2/D1) = 2. Therefore, the increase factor is 2^2.63. We know 2^2 = 4 and 2^3 = 8. Calculating 2^2.63 gives a value of approximately 6.18, which is closest to 6.2."

A bib tap (or bibcock) is a draw-off tap with a downward-pointing, bent nozzle, designed for conveniently filling sinks, buckets, etc. A stop cock (or stop valve) is an in-line valve installed within the pipework, designed purely to start or stop the flow to a section of the plumbing system for isolation or control, not for regular drawing of water."
