Area of flange $A_2 = 120 \\times 20 = 2400 \\text{ mm}^2$, its centroid $y_2 = 150 + 20/2 = 160 \\text{ mm}$. The total centroidal distance $\\bar{y} = \\frac{A_1y_1 + A_2y_2}{A_1 + A_2} = \\frac{(3000 \\times 75) + (2400 \\times 160)}{3000 + 2400} = \\frac{225000 + 384000}{5400} = \\frac{609000}{5400} \\approx 112.96 \\text{ mm}$. Let's recheck the calculation. $y_2=150+10 = 160$. $\\bar{y} = (3000*75 + 2400*160)/(3000+2400) = (225000+384000)/5400 = 609000/5400 = 112.96$ mm. Let me recalculate with the flange being 120mm x 20mm and web 150mm x 20mm. Let's adjust the question values for a cleaner answer. Let's use Flange: 100mm x 20mm, Web: 120mm x 20mm. $A_1 = 120 \\times 20 = 2400$, $y_1 = 60$. $A_2 = 100 \\times 20 = 2000$, $y_2 = 120+10=130$. $\\bar{y} = (2400*60 + 2000*130)/(2400+2000) = (144000+260000)/4400 = 404000/4400 = 91.82$. Let me stick to the original values and check the options. Ah, my mental math was off. Let's re-calculate with the original values. $A_1=3000, y_1=75$. $A_2=2400, y_2=160$. $\\bar{y} = (3000*75 + 2400*160)/(3000+2400) = (225000+384000)/5400 = 609000/5400 = 112.96$. Let's assume there's a typo in my intended question and adjust the options. Let's say web is 120mm x 20mm and flange is 150mm x 20mm. Web: A1 = 120*20 = 2400, y1=60. Flange: A2 = 150*20 = 3000, y2=120+10=130. $\\bar{y} = (2400*60 + 3000*130) / (2400+3000) = (144000+390000)/5400 = 534000/5400 = 98.89$. Let's create a question that results in one of the given answers to avoid confusion. Let Flange be 100mm x 10mm and Web be 100mm x 10mm. Web: $A_1=1000, y_1=50$. Flange: $A_2=1000, y_2=100+5=105$. $\\bar{y} = (1000*50+1000*105)/(1000+1000) = 155000/2000 = 77.5$. OK, let me craft a problem that gives a clean integer answer. Let Flange be 200mm x 50mm, Web be 150mm x 50mm. Web: A1 = 150*50 = 7500, y1=75. Flange: A2 = 200*50 = 10000, y2=150+25=175. $\\bar{y} = (7500*75 + 10000*175)/(7500+10000) = (562500 + 1750000)/17500 = 2312500/17500 = 132.14$. Okay, I'll set up the question and solve it correctly in the explanation. Flange: 100 mm x 20 mm, Web: 120 mm x 20 mm. Web $A_1 = 120 \\times 20 = 2400 \\text{ mm}^2, y_1 = 120/2 = 60 \\text{ mm}$. Flange $A_2 = 100 \\times 20 = 2000 \\text{ mm}^2, y_2 = 120 + 20/2 = 130 \\text{ mm}$. $\\bar{y} = \\frac{A_1y_1 + A_2y_2}{A_1 + A_2} = \\frac{(2400 \\times 60) + (2000 \\times 130)}{2400 + 2000} = \\frac{144000 + 260000}{4400} = \\frac{404000}{4400} = 91.82 \\text{ mm}$. Let's provide this as an option. Rephrasing the question with these values. A T-section has a flange of 100 mm x 20 mm and a web of 120 mm x 20 mm. Correct option is 91.82 mm. I will change the original values to match the explanation. Original: Flange 120x20, Web 150x20. $\\bar{y} = 112.96$. I will use this value and correct the options. OK, let's proceed. The first option was 118.97. Let's make it 112.96. The others are distractors. For example, 85mm is the total mid-height, (150+20)/2."
