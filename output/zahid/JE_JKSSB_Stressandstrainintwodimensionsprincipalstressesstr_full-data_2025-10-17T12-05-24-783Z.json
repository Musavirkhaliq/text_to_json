  "description": "A comprehensive practice examination designed for aspirants of the JKSSB Junior Engineer (Civil) recruitment. This professional academic assessment meticulously evaluates your understanding of complex stress and bending theories at an undergraduate level, mirroring the standards and question patterns of the JKSSB exam. The test features a balanced mix of practical application problems and conceptual questions to build a robust foundation in critical areas of structural analysis. Key topics covered include:\n\n- **Stress & Strain Analysis:** In-depth coverage of two-dimensional stress and strain, determination of principal stresses ($\\sigma_{1,2}$) and maximum shear stress, and stress transformation using Mohr's circle.\n- **Bending Theory:** Application of simple bending theory, calculation of flexural and shear stresses in beams, and analysis of stress distribution across various cross-sections.\n- **Advanced Bending Concepts:** Challenging questions on unsymmetrical bending and the determination of the shear centre for thin-walled sections.\n\nThis assessment is an essential tool for identifying strengths and weaknesses in core Mechanics and Structural Analysis subjects, ensuring you are thoroughly prepared for the competitive examination.",

Option A is the most complete correct statement, as the fixed end is part of the beam where this constant shear force exists."

When a load is applied along an axis that is not a principal axis, unsymmetrical bending occurs. In this case, the neutral axis will be inclined to the loading axis. The angle of inclination depends on the moments of inertia $I_u, I_v$ and the product of inertia $I_{uv}$."
