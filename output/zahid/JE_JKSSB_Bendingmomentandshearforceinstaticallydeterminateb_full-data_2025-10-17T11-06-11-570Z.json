  "title": "JKSSB JE (Civil) Focused Assessment: Shear Force, Bending Moment, and Simple Stress-Strain Analysis",
  "description": "This professional academic assessment is meticulously designed for aspirants of the JKSSB Junior Engineer (Civil) examination. It provides a focused evaluation of core undergraduate-level concepts within Mechanics and Structural Analysis, specifically targeting Shear Force and Bending Moment diagrams for statically determinate beams, and the fundamental principles of Simple Stress and Strain relationships ($ \\sigma = E\\epsilon $). The test features a balanced mix of practical and conceptual questions that reflect the difficulty and standards of the JKSSB exam, enabling candidates to rigorously test their analytical skills and theoretical knowledge.",

        },

        },

          "text": "Parabolic curve with maximum ordinate $wL^2/8$",
          "isCorrect": true

          "text": "Cubic curve",
          "isCorrect": false
        }
      ],
      "points": 2,
      "explanation": "The relationship between load (w), shear force (V), and bending moment (M) is $dV/dx = -w$ and $dM/dx = V$. For a constant load (UDL), the shear force diagram is linear (1st degree). Integrating a linear function results in a bending moment diagram that is a parabolic curve (2nd degree)."

          "isCorrect": true
        }
      ],
      "points": 2,
      "explanation": "The hole acts as a stress concentrator. The lines of stress must flow around the discontinuity, causing them to crowd together at the edges of the hole perpendicular to the applied load. This results in a localized stress that is significantly higher than the average nominal stress."
