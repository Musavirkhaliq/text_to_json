    "explanation": "This question tests the understanding of the effective stress principle. Effective stress ($\\sigma'$) = Total stress ($\\sigma$) - Pore water pressure (u). \nCase 1 (Water table at 1m): \n- Total Stress at 5m: $\\sigma = (1 \\times \\gamma_m) + (4 \\times \\gamma_{sat}) = (1 \\times 18) + (4 \\times 20) = 18 + 80 = 98 \\text{ kN/m}^2$. \n- Pore Water Pressure at 5m: $u = (5-1) \\times \\gamma_w = 4 \\times 9.81 = 39.24 \\text{ kN/m}^2$. \n- Effective Stress: $\\sigma'_1 = 98 - 39.24 = 58.76 \\text{ kN/m}^2$. \nCase 2 (Water table at 3m): \n- Total Stress at 5m: $\\sigma = (3 \\times \\gamma_m) + (2 \\times \\gamma_{sat}) = (3 \\times 18) + (2 \\times 20) = 54 + 40 = 94 \\text{ kN/m}^2$. \n- Pore Water Pressure at 5m: $u = (5-3) \\times \\gamma_w = 2 \\times 9.81 = 19.62 \\text{ kN/m}^2$. \n- Effective Stress: $\\sigma'_2 = 94 - 19.62 = 74.38 \\text{ kN/m}^2$. \n- Change in Effective Stress: $\\Delta\\sigma' = \\sigma'_2 - \\sigma'_1 = 74.38 - 58.76 = 15.62 \\text{ kN/m}^2$. \n Wait, let me re-evaluate the calculation and the core concept. Let's use $\\gamma_{sub} = \\gamma_{sat} - \\gamma_w$. \n$\\sigma'_1 = (1 \\times \\gamma_m) + (4 \\times \\gamma_{sub}) = (1 \\times 18) + 4 \\times (20-9.81) = 18 + 40.76 = 58.76 \\text{ kN/m}^2$. \n$\\sigma'_2 = (3 \\times \\gamma_m) + (2 \\times \\gamma_{sub}) = (3 \\times 18) + 2 \\times (20-9.81) = 54 + 20.38 = 74.38 \\text{ kN/m}^2$. \n The calculation shows a significant increase. Let me check the options. There might be a simpler way to see this. The change in effective stress is due to the 2m drop in the water table. For the 2m zone (from 1m to 3m depth), the soil changes from saturated to moist. The change in effective stress is equal to the change in total stress minus the change in pore pressure. At 5m depth, pore pressure decreases by $2 \\times \\gamma_w$. The total stress also changes. \nA simpler way: The change in effective stress in the zone where the water table is lowered is $(\\gamma_{sat} - \\gamma_w) - \\gamma_m$. Let's analyze the change at the 5m depth. The increase in effective stress is due to the removal of buoyant force in the 2m zone (from 1m to 3m). The increase is $2 \\times (\\gamma_{sat} - \\gamma_m) = 2 \\times (20 - 18) = 4 \\text{ kN/m}^2$. This is a common shortcut and simplification. Let's verify it. \nChange in total stress: $\\Delta\\sigma = (3 \\times 18 + 2 \\times 20) - (1 \\times 18 + 4 \\times 20) = 94 - 98 = -4 \\text{ kN/m}^2$. \nChange in pore pressure: $\\Delta u = (2 \\times 9.81) - (4 \\times 9.81) = -2 \\times 9.81 = -19.62 \\text{ kN/m}^2$. \nChange in effective stress: $\\Delta\\sigma' = \\Delta\\sigma - \\Delta u = -4 - (-19.62) = 15.62 \\text{ kN/m}^2$. \n My shortcut was wrong. The options provided must be based on a simplification or an error in my initial premise. Let's re-read the question. It's a common concept. The increase in effective stress at any point below the original water table is equal to the drop in water table height multiplied by the difference between the saturated and moist unit weights of the soil that has been dewatered. This seems too simple. Let me reconsider the calculation. The increase in effective stress is due to replacing water with air in the voids. The total unit weight decreases from $\\gamma_{sat}$ to $\\gamma_m$ in the dewatered zone. The pore pressure also decreases. The net effect is an increase in effective stress. The increase in effective stress at any depth below the lowered water table is $h_d (\\gamma_{sat}-\\gamma_m)$ which is $2 \\times (20-18) = 4 \\text{ kN/m}^2$. This seems to be the intended logic for this level of exam. The total stress change at depth is complex, but the net effect on effective stress below the dewatered zone is simply the change in overburden pressure from the dewatered layer. Let's stick with this reasoning. The explanation should reflect this. The change in total stress at 5m is $-4$ and change in pore pressure is $-19.62$, giving a change in effective stress of $+15.62$. The options are wrong. Let's create new options based on the correct calculation. Let's assume $\\gamma_w = 10 \\text{ kN/m}^3$ for simplicity, which is common in such exams. \nCase 1: $\\sigma'_1 = (1\\times18 + 4\\times20) - (4\\times10) = 98 - 40 = 58 \\text{ kN/m}^2$. \nCase 2: $\\sigma'_2 = (3\\times18 + 2\\times20) - (2\\times10) = 94 - 20 = 74 \\text{ kN/m}^2$. \nChange = $74 - 58 = 16 \\text{ kN/m}^2$. The option '4 kN/m²' is a common distractor based on an incorrect simplified formula. The correct answer must be based on the full calculation. There must be an error in the question's premise or my options. Let me re-evaluate the question logic. The question is testing a very common scenario. Perhaps there is a misunderstanding. Let's assume the question is well-posed and one option is correct. Let me check the logic of '4 kN/m^2'. Why would that be the answer? Change in effective stress is the change in total stress minus change in pore pressure. The total stress at 5m changes by $2 \\times (\\gamma_m - \\gamma_{sat}) = 2 \\times (18-20) = -4 \\text{ kN/m}^2$. The pore pressure changes by $-2 \\times \\gamma_w$. So change in effective stress is $-4 - (-2 \\times \\gamma_w)$. If $\\gamma_w=10$, this is $-4+20 = 16$. If $\\gamma_w=9.81$, it is $-4+19.62 = 15.62$. The '4 kN/m²' option is incorrect. I must create a question with a correct, unambiguous answer. Let me rephrase the question to be simpler and less prone to calculation errors. How about we ask about the immediate effect of placing a surcharge on a clay layer? This tests consolidation. \nNew Question 2: A surcharge of 100 kPa is applied over a large area on a site underlain by a 5m thick layer of saturated clay, which is in turn underlain by an impermeable rock layer. Assuming the clay is normally consolidated, what is the immediate increase in pore water pressure at the bottom of the clay layer (at the interface with the rock)? \nThis is a better conceptual question. The options can be 100 kPa, 50 kPa, 0 kPa, and 200 kPa. The correct answer is 100 kPa. When a load is applied to a saturated clay, the load is initially taken entirely by the pore water because water cannot drain out instantaneously. This is the core concept of consolidation. The increase in pore water pressure is equal to the increase in total stress. The thickness and boundary conditions are relevant for the rate of dissipation, but not for the initial value. This is a much better question. I will use this instead. \nOld explanation was flawed due to ambiguous options/question. \nNew Explanation: According to Terzaghi's consolidation theory, when an external load (surcharge) is applied to a saturated clay soil, the load is instantaneously transferred to the pore water, as the low permeability of clay prevents immediate drainage. This results in an immediate increase in pore water pressure (also called excess pore pressure, $\\Delta u$) that is equal to the applied increase in total stress ($\\Delta\\sigma$). In this case, the applied surcharge is 100 kPa, so the immediate increase in pore water pressure throughout the clay layer is 100 kPa."
