    "explanation": "The Born-Oppenheimer approximation is a fundamental concept in quantum chemistry that simplifies the calculation of molecular wavefunctions by separating the electronic and nuclear motions.  It assumes that the electrons move so much faster than the nuclei that the electronic wavefunction can be calculated for a fixed nuclear configuration. This significantly reduces the complexity of solving the time-independent Schrödinger equation.  The approximation's validity relies on the significant difference in mass between electrons and nuclei.  However, its limitations become apparent when dealing with light molecules (like H2) where the large nuclear velocities can lead to a significant coupling between electronic and nuclear motions, making the separation of variables invalid.  Another limitation arises in cases with close-lying electronic energy levels, where the Born-Oppenheimer approximation breaks down, requiring more sophisticated methods for accurate calculations."
