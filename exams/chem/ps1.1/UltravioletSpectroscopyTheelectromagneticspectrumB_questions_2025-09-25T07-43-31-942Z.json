Consequently, the energy gap between an n orbital and an excited π* orbital (n → π*) is usually smaller than the energy gap between a π orbital and an excited π* orbital (π → π*).

The amino group (-NH₂) in aniline is a strong electron-donating auxochrome. It extends the conjugation of the benzene ring through resonance, effectively delocalizing the π-electrons over a larger system and lowering the energy of the π* molecular orbital. This reduces the π → π* energy gap, leading to absorption at longer wavelengths (red shift). While the nitro group (-NO₂) in nitrobenzene is also an auxochrome and extends conjugation, its electron-withdrawing nature typically causes a less pronounced bathochromic shift for the primary π → π* band compared to the strong electron-donating amino group, or can even cause a blue shift in some cases for certain bands. For the primary π → π* transition, aniline will exhibit the longest λmax."

Conversely, a very low ε value (< 100) indicates a 'forbidden' or 'weakly allowed' transition.

The presence of a second, weaker band at a significantly longer wavelength (270 nm) with a much lower molar absorptivity (ε ~ 200) strongly suggests the presence of an impurity. This impurity would be absorbing at a longer wavelength, implying a more extended conjugation or a different chromophore (e.g., an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl which typically shows an n → π* transition in this region with low ε, or a more highly conjugated species). Overtones in UV-Vis are not typically observed as distinct, separate bands in this manner.

      "explanation": "The correct option is B. The absorption bands of benzene are classic examples of π→π* transitions. The strong band at ~180 nm is the first allowed π→π* transition (often called the E1 band or sometimes the E band in older literature). The band at ~200 nm is another allowed π→π* transition (E2 band or K band, due to conjugation). The weakest band at ~255 nm is the B (benzenoid) band, which is symmetry-forbidden according to the C6h point group selection rules. Its observation is attributed to vibronic coupling, where coupling between electronic and vibrational transitions relaxes the selection rule, allowing for a weak absorption. There are no n→π* or σ→σ* transitions relevant to these bands in benzene."

      "explanation": "The correct option is B. Planarity and rigidity are crucial for efficient p-orbital overlap in conjugated systems. In a rigid, planar molecule, the chromophore maintains optimal geometry for electron delocalization across the entire conjugated system, leading to a smaller HOMO-LUMO gap and thus a bathochromic (red) shift (longer λmax). Furthermore, the transition moment integral is maximized, resulting in a higher probability of absorption, which manifests as an increased molar absorptivity (ε). In contrast, a flexible analog may have parts of its conjugation disrupted by conformational changes (e.g., twisting), reducing effective conjugation and leading to a hypsochromic shift and decreased ε."

      "explanation": "The correct option is C. Alkyl groups are generally considered auxochromes when attached to a chromophore. They are weak electron donors through hyperconjugation, which can extend the conjugation subtly, lowering the energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO. This results in a shift of the absorption maximum to longer wavelengths (bathochromic shift). The slight increase in ε (hyperchromic effect) also aligns with the idea of enhanced delocalization. The Beer-Lambert law describes absorbance as a function of concentration, not a shift in λmax. Hypsochromic effect is a blue shift, and hyperchromic refers to increased intensity, not the cause of the shift itself, though it may accompany a bathochromic shift."

      "points": 4,
      "explanation": "The correct option is B. The Franck-Condon principle states that electronic transitions occur much faster than nuclear motion, so they are 'vertical' on a potential energy diagram. This means the molecule transitions from a vibrational level of the ground electronic state to a vibrational level of the excited electronic state without a change in internuclear distance. If the equilibrium geometries of the ground and excited states are significantly different (e.g., a change in bond length or angle upon excitation), the overlap integrals between the ground state vibrational wavefunction and several excited state vibrational wavefunctions will be significant. This results in transitions to multiple vibrational levels of the excited state, leading to a series of closely spaced absorption bands, known as vibrational fine structure. The n→π* transition in carbonyls involves changing the geometry (e.g., C-O bond length often increases, and the molecule might become non-planar), making vibrational fine structure observable under high resolution, especially in non-polar solvents at low temperatures."

Conjugation leads to a delocalization of π electrons, which lowers the energy of the π→π* transition, resulting in a bathochromic (red) shift to a longer λmax. Furthermore, conjugated systems generally exhibit higher molar absorptivities (ε) because the transition dipole moment is larger. Therefore, 1,3-cyclohexadiene will absorb at a significantly longer wavelength and with higher intensity compared to 1,4-cyclohexadiene, which would only absorb in the vacuum UV region (similar to two isolated ethene units)."

The selection rule ΔS = 0 dictates that electronic transitions should conserve spin multiplicity (e.g., singlet-singlet or triplet-triplet transitions are allowed, but singlet-triplet are forbidden). Phosphorescence involves a transition from an excited triplet state (T1) to a ground singlet state (S0), which is spin-forbidden. However, spin-orbit coupling, an interaction between the spin angular momentum and the orbital angular momentum of electrons, can mix states of different spin multiplicities. This mixing allows for a small probability of spin-forbidden transitions, making phosphorescence observable, albeit with a much longer lifetime than fluorescence."

Fluorescence is a radiative process where a molecule in its first excited singlet state (S1) returns to the ground singlet state (S0) by emitting a photon. This typically occurs after the molecule undergoes rapid vibrational relaxation (internal conversion) to the lowest vibrational level of the S1 state, following initial excitation. The emission wavelength is generally longer than the absorption wavelength due to this energy loss (Stokes shift). If a molecule is fluorescent, it implies that internal conversion and fluorescence are competitive with or faster than intersystem crossing to a triplet state, or other non-radiative pathways. Phosphorescence involves the triplet state, not fluorescence."
