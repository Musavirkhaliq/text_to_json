    "explanation": "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with the help of chlorophyll.  Chlorophyll absorbs light energy, which is then used to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose (a sugar) and oxygen.  This process occurs in chloroplasts within plant cells. The overall equation is: 6CO2 + 6H2O + Light Energy â†’ C6H12O6 + 6O2.  The glucose serves as food for the plant, providing energy for growth and other metabolic processes, while oxygen is released as a byproduct."
